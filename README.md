## FAQ
### Why does it have so many errors?
This project is still in development, so there are many bugs.

### Why is the glitch.com editor crashing?
The code is somewhat funky with including files, so when you open a large file, it may crash the extension.

### What all does it work on?
This extension is made for chrome. It will probably only work on chrome.

### What is the Input autocompletion?
- Input is [Engine.js](https://engine-js.glitch.me/). I use it with most of my projects, so it is included.
